# VISION.md — Savant Architecture & Long-Term Vision
Author: Amd  
Purpose: Product team alignment + long-term direction + GTM clarity

# 1. What Savant Is
Savant is a developer-first, local-first agent platform designed to give engineering teams real autonomy and superpowers.
Where Wand AI focuses on business users with no-code blocks, Savant provides deep control, extensibility, and true agent intelligence.

Savant enables:
- agentic MR review
- agentic code generation
- repo understanding
- code migrations
- workflow automation
- multi-agent orchestration
- local compute via Ollama
- rich MCP integration

Savant is the agent OS for engineering teams.

# 2. Long-Term Identity (10-Year Vision)
Savant becomes the default agent runtime for developers, the way:
- Docker became default for containers
- VSCode became default for IDEs
- Git became default for source control

Savant = the execution substrate for all agentic developer tools.

Agents run:
- locally
- on-prem
- inside terminals
- inside IDEs
- as background dev daemons
- in CI/CD
- as enterprise workflows

Savant becomes the global MCP Hub: tools, models, workflows, and agents unified.

# 3. 3-Year Category Creation
Savant defines a new category:

## Agent Infrastructure Platform (AIP)

Not prompt tooling.  
Not flow builder.  
Not RPA.  
Not Copilot.

AIP = agent runtime + orchestrator + workflow engine + MCP router + plugin ecosystem.

Every AI dev tool eventually integrates with Savant.

# 4. Medium-Term Vision (12–18 Months)
## Savant Engine (Local Runtime)
- developer-first CLI
- local/offline execution
- MCP multiplexer
- agent runtime

## Savant Hub (UI Layer)
- visual workflow builder
- tool graph
- logs + observability
- credentials vault
- marketplace

## Savant Cloud (Enterprise)
- team workspaces
- multi-agent clusters
- RBAC
- audit logs
- compliance mode

Together: The Savant Platform.

# 5. Mission Statement
Empower every developer and engineering team to build and run AI agents with maximum speed, control, and safety — without giving up privacy, ownership, or autonomy.

Pillars:
- Developer-first
- Local-first
- Extensible-as-hell

# 6. Product Philosophy
A. Ship fast, ship small  
B. Agents write 80–90% of the code  
C. Everything modular  
D. Developer delight above all  
E. Local-first UX  
F. Only build what has real-world developer value  

# 7. Go-To-Market Strategy (Fast GTM)
## Phase 1 — Win Developers (Open Source)
- Savant Engine release
- killer agents (MR Review, Migration, TDD)
- docs + templates
- CLI-focused workflows

## Phase 2 — Win Teams
- Hub UI
- observability
- workflow orchestration
- credentials vault

## Phase 3 — Win Enterprise
- Savant Cloud
- security suite
- compliance layer
- on-prem distribution

# 8. Strategic Differentiators
1. Developer Power  
2. Local-First Security  
3. Extensibility / Plugin Ecosystem  
4. Multi-Agent Orchestration  

# 9. 10-Year North Star
Savant becomes the “Kubernetes of AI agents”:  
The universal open standard for agent execution and orchestration.

# 10. Success Metrics
## 12 Months
- 1k developers
- 10 enterprise pilots
- Hub UI alpha
- Marketplace prototype

## 3 Years
- 100k developers
- integrated into GitHub/GitLab/JetBrains ecosystems
- Enterprise revenue scaling

## 10 Years
- Savant = default infrastructure for AI-powered engineering
