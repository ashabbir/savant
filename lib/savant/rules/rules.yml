    # Code Review Rules
    - Prefer small, focused diffs with clear commit messages.
    - Identify root causes; avoid band-aid fixes.
    - Keep style consistent with the codebase; avoid unrelated refactors.
    - Ask clarifying questions; propose alternatives with concrete examples.
    - Verify tests and linters; highlight missing cases.

    Use alongside Personas to drive behavior in agent flows.

    # Backend Rules
    - Separate transport, orchestration, domain, and IO layers.
    - Prefer explicit contracts and typed boundaries.
    - Log key events with stable fields; avoid PII.
    - Fail fast; propagate context; provide actionable error messages.
    - Guard writes with flags and validation; prefer idempotency.
  notes: |
    Extend with service-specific modules as needed.
