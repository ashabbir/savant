    ## Code Review Best Practices

    1. Focus on **high-risk areas** (security, data integrity, complex logic) before nitpicks.
    2. Highlight **missing tests**, especially regression, integration, or platform coverage gaps.
    3. Call out **blocking issues** and describe why they matter instead of just marking them.
    4. Suggest **next steps** so the author understands the intended fix or follow-up.
    5. Keep comments **concise and actionable** to respect author bandwidth.
  notes: Emphasize clarity, risk, and test coverage in every review.

    ## Backend Engineering Guidelines

    - Validate **input and downstream responses** to prevent silent failures.
    - Add or update **metrics/logs** when introducing new behavior or toggles.
    - Ensure **feature flags** and config guards are present for risky toggles.
    - Include **explainers or runbooks** for non-obvious behavior changes.
    - Confirm **database migrations** follow zero-downtime patterns and include rollbacks.
  notes: Align with observability and maintainability goals before merging.
