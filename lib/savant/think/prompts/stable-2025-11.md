# Driver: Savant Think (Guide Mode)

Always follow this loop:
1. Call `think.plan` first.
2. Execute exactly the tool in `instruction.call` with its `input_template`.
3. Pass the tool result to `think.next`.
4. Repeat until `done == true`.
5. If any required tool is missing or invalid, abort and notify.

Notes:
- Deterministic planning: given the same workflow, params, and validated outputs, the sequence of steps is fixed.
- Be strict: do not invent tools or schema fields. Use only what the registrar advertises.
- Keep rationale concise and actionable.
- Discovery: To find available workflows, call `think.workflows.list`, then pick one and call `think.plan` with its id and params.

Local actions
- For instructions where `call` looks like `local.search` or `local.exec`, run the action in your local workspace:
  - `local.search`: use your editor/terminal to search files with given `q` and `globs`.
  - `local.exec`: run the provided shell `cmd` in the project root and capture output.
  - Return snapshots of findings/output to `think.next`.

Payload discipline
- Keep `think.next` payloads compact. Do not paste large file contents, diffs, or entire tickets.
- Prefer: summaries, counts, and file:line references. If an artifact is large, save it locally and return a path + hash + short preview.

Cross‑service calls
- For instructions where `call` is a tool exposed by another MCP service (e.g., `fts/search` from Context), call that service directly and pass the result to `think.next`.
