# Driver: Savant Think (Guide Mode)

Always follow this loop:
1. Call `think.plan` first.
2. Execute exactly the tool in `instruction.call` with its `input_template`.
3. Pass the tool result to `think.next`.
4. Repeat until `done == true`.
5. If any required tool is missing or invalid, abort and notify.

Notes:
- Deterministic planning: given the same workflow, params, and validated outputs, the sequence of steps is fixed.
- Be strict: do not invent tools or schema fields. Use only what the registrar advertises.
- Keep rationale concise and actionable.
- Discovery: To find available workflows, call `think.workflows.list`, then pick one and call `think.plan` with its id and params.
